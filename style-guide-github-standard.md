# GitHub Standards Style Guide

This document provides standards and best practices for managing repositories, collaborating on code, and maintaining consistency across GitHub projects. Adhering to these guidelines ensures an organized and efficient workflow.

## Repository Structure
- **Consistent Layout:** Organize files into logical directories (e.g., `src/`, `docs/`, `tests/`).
- **README.md:** Every repository must have a well-written `README.md` file describing the project, setup instructions, and usage.
- **LICENSE:** Include a license file to clarify the terms under which the code can be used.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md:** Provide clear guidelines for contributors, including coding standards and contribution steps.
- **CHANGELOG.md:** Maintain a changelog to track changes between releases.

---

## Branching Strategy
- Use **main** or **master** as the default branch for production-ready code.
- Follow a branching convention:
  - **feature/** for new features (e.g., `feature/add-login`).
  - **fix/** for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/typo-in-docs`).
  - **release/** for preparing releases (e.g., `release/v1.0`).
  - **hotfix/** for critical fixes in production (e.g., `hotfix/critical-bug`).
- Always branch from and merge back into the default branch unless specified otherwise.

---

## Commit Messages
- Write concise and descriptive commit messages:
  - Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature X" instead of "Added feature X").
  - Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
  - Add a blank line, followed by a detailed explanation if necessary.
- Example:
  Add feature to process user data

This commit introduces a feature to process user data efficiently, including validation and transformation logic.

- Reference related issues or pull requests (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

---

## Pull Requests and Code Reviews
- **Pull Requests (PRs):**
- Use descriptive titles and provide a summary in the description.
- Ensure the PR is linked to relevant issues or tasks.
- Keep PRs small and focused on a single feature or fix.
- **Code Reviews:**
- Reviewers must check for code quality, standards, and potential issues.
- Use constructive feedback and suggest improvements.
- Ensure all checks (tests, CI/CD pipelines) pass before approving.

---

## Issues and Labels
- Clearly describe issues with steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual results.
- Use labels to categorize issues (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`).
- Assign issues to team members and set milestones where applicable.
- Close issues only when the related work is complete and merged.

---

## GitHub Actions and Workflows
- Use GitHub Actions to automate tasks like testing, deployment, and code analysis.
- Define workflows in `.github/workflows/` using YAML files.
- Ensure workflows are efficient and include:
- **Linting** for code style enforcement.
- **Unit tests** for code validation.
- **Build and deploy** steps for production readiness.
- Use secrets for sensitive data in workflows (e.g., API keys).

---

## Repository Settings
- Enable branch protection rules for the default branch:
- Require pull requests before merging.
- Enforce status checks and code reviews.
- Use CODEOWNERS to define ownership of specific files or directories.
- Enable Dependabot for dependency updates and vulnerability scanning.
- Archive inactive repositories to avoid confusion.

---

## Documentation Standards
- Maintain up-to-date documentation for all repositories.
- Use Markdown (`.md`) files for documentation:
- `README.md` for project overview.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for behavioral expectations.
- Include diagrams or visuals where necessary to explain workflows.

---

## Security and Compliance
- Regularly review repository access and permissions.
- Use GitHub's built-in security features:
- Enable **Vulnerability Alerts**.
- Use **Secret Scanning** to detect exposed credentials.
- Avoid committing sensitive data (e.g., passwords, private keys).
- Use two-factor authentication (2FA) for all accounts.
