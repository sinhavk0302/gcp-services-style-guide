## Introduction

Google Cloud Dataproc is a fast, easy-to-use, fully managed cloud service for running Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, and other open-source big data tools. This style guide outlines the standards for configuring, deploying, and managing Dataproc clusters and workloads.

---

## Cluster Configuration

1. **Cluster Naming**:
   - Use descriptive and consistent names. Example: `project-name-job-type-cluster`.
   - Include environment identifiers such as `dev`, `test`, or `prod`.

2. **Cluster Sizing**:
   - Start with minimum resources and scale based on job requirements.
   - Use preemptible VMs for cost optimization where possible.

3. **Image Version**:
   - Use the latest stable Dataproc image version.
   - Specify the image explicitly during cluster creation.

4. **Autoscaling**:
   - Enable autoscaling policies to handle varying workloads effectively.
   - Define autoscaling limits to prevent excessive resource usage.

5. **Network Configuration**:
   - Use private IPs for Dataproc clusters.
   - Ensure clusters are deployed in the same region as the data sources.

## Job Management Standards

1. **Job Submission**:
   - Use `gcloud` CLI, REST API, or workflows for job submission.
   - Avoid manual submission for production workloads.

2. **Job Naming**:
   - Use meaningful names to describe the job purpose. Example: `daily-sales-report`.

3. **Retries**:
   - Configure retries for transient failures.
   - Use exponential backoff for retry delays.

4. **Scheduling**:
   - Use Cloud Scheduler or workflows to automate job execution.
   - Include job dependencies and order of execution in workflows.

5. **Job Types**:
   - Use Spark for real-time analytics and Hadoop for batch processing.
   - Define clear input and output paths for jobs.

## Data Processing Best Practices

1. **Storage**:
   - Use Cloud Storage buckets for input and output data.
   - Organize data using structured folder hierarchies.

2. **Optimization**:
   - Partition data to improve job performance.
   - Cache frequently accessed data in memory where applicable.

3. **File Formats**:
   - Use efficient file formats like Parquet or Avro for large datasets.
   - Compress files to reduce storage costs and improve processing speeds.

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Follow PEP 8 for Python or applicable coding standards for other languages.
   - Modularize code into reusable functions or libraries.

---

## Security Best Practices

1. **IAM Roles**:
   - Assign roles using the principle of least privilege.
   - Avoid assigning owner roles to service accounts or users.

2. **Encryption**:
   - Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit.
   - Use CMEK (Customer-Managed Encryption Keys) for sensitive data.

3. **Secrets Management**:
   - Use Secret Manager to store sensitive information.
   - Avoid hardcoding credentials in job scripts.

4. **Audit Logging**:
   - Enable Cloud Audit Logs for Dataproc to monitor access and actions.
   - Regularly review logs for suspicious activity.

---

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

1. **Monitoring**:
   - Enable Stackdriver Monitoring for cluster metrics.
   - Set up alerts for cluster health and job failures.

2. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Use Dataproc’s web UI to debug failed jobs.
   - Review job driver and worker logs for errors.

3. **Performance Tuning**:
   - Monitor job execution times and adjust cluster resources as needed.
   - Optimize Spark and Hadoop configurations for better performance.
