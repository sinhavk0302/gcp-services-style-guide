## Introduction

BigQuery is GCP's serverless, highly scalable data warehouse designed for analytics. This guide ensures consistent design, maintainability, and performance of BigQuery datasets, tables, and views while following organizational standards.

---

## Dataset Standards

1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use lowercase letters with underscores (`_`) for dataset names.
   - Format: `project_environment_purpose`. Example: `ecommerce_prod_analytics`.

2. **Data Organization**:
   - Group datasets by business domain or use case.
   - Avoid mixing unrelated data in the same dataset.

3. **Labels**:
   - Apply labels for organization, cost tracking, and filtering.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     labels:
       environment: "prod"
       department: "finance"
     ```

4. **Region Selection**:
   - Store datasets in regions close to their data source or consuming applications.
   - Use multi-regional locations for global datasets.

5. **Retention Policies**:
   - Set dataset-level retention policies to manage data lifecycle effectively.

## Table Standards

1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use meaningful, lowercase names with underscores.
   - Format: `data_purpose_timeframe`. Example: `sales_transactions_2025`.

2. **Schema Design**:
   - Use descriptive column names in lowercase with underscores.
   - Avoid reserved keywords and special characters in column names.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     columns:
       - name: customer_id
         type: STRING
       - name: order_date
         type: DATE
     ```

3. **Partitioning**:
   - Use partitioned tables for large datasets.
   - Prefer `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP` columns for partitioning.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     PARTITION BY DATE(order_date)
     ```

4. **Clustering**:
   - Cluster tables by frequently queried columns.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CLUSTER BY customer_id, region
     ```

5. **Data Types**:
   - Use appropriate data types for storage efficiency and performance:
     - `STRING` for text data.
     - `INTEGER` or `FLOAT` for numeric data.
     - `TIMESTAMP` or `DATE` for time-based data.

6. **Temporary Tables**:
   - Use temporary tables for intermediate processing to avoid cluttering permanent storage.

---

## View Standards

1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Prefix view names with `view_`.
   - Example: `view_customer_orders`.

2. **Types of Views**:
   - Use **standard views** for reusable queries.
   - Use **materialized views** for frequently accessed data to improve performance.

3. **SQL Formatting**:
   - Follow consistent SQL formatting for readability:
     ```sql
     CREATE VIEW `project.dataset.view_customer_orders` AS
     SELECT
         customer_id,
         COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
     FROM
         `project.dataset.orders`
     WHERE
         order_status = 'completed'
     GROUP BY
         customer_id;
     ```

4. **Avoid Nested Views**:
   - Minimize deeply nested views to simplify maintenance and debugging.

5. **Access Control**:
   - Restrict access to views based on user roles.

---

## Access Controls and Permissions

1. **IAM Roles**:
   - Use predefined roles such as:
     - `BigQuery Data Viewer` for read-only access.
     - `BigQuery Data Editor` for data manipulation.
     - `BigQuery Admin` for administrative tasks.

2. **Service Accounts**:
   - Use service accounts for automated processes accessing BigQuery.

3. **Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Grant only the required permissions to users and service accounts.

4. **Audit Logs**:
   - Enable Cloud Audit Logs to monitor access and operations.

---

## Performance Optimization

1. **Query Optimization**:
   - Always specify required columns instead of using `SELECT *`.
   - Push down filters in queries to reduce scanned data.

2. **Denormalization**:
   - Use denormalized schemas for analytical workloads to reduce joins.

3. **Partitioning and Clustering**:
   - Use partitioning and clustering to optimize query performance for large tables.

4. **Storage Classes**:
   - Optimize storage costs by using appropriate storage classes (e.g., active vs. long-term).

5. **Query Caching**:
   - Leverage BigQuery's query caching for repeated queries to reduce costs.

---

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Monitoring**:
   - Use Cloud Monitoring to track query performance, storage usage, and cost metrics.

2. **Validation**:
   - Validate data integrity using checksums and row counts after ETL or migrations.

3. **Query Logging**:
   - Enable query logs to monitor usage patterns and optimize queries.

4. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Use snapshots or export data to Cloud Storage for backup purposes.

5. **Cost Management**:
   - Regularly review and optimize queries and storage to control costs.
