## Introduction

Google Cloud Storage is a scalable, secure, and durable object storage service for developers and enterprises. This style guide outlines the standards for creating, managing, and securing Cloud Storage buckets and objects.

---

## Bucket Configuration

1. **Bucket Naming**:
   - Use descriptive and consistent names. Example: `project-name-environment-purpose`.
   - Follow DNS naming conventions (lowercase, alphanumeric, no underscores).

2. **Bucket Location**:
   - Choose a bucket location close to your users or data sources.
   - Use multi-regional storage for global access and regional storage for lower latency.

3. **Storage Class**:
   - Use the appropriate storage class based on access frequency:
     - `Standard` for frequently accessed data.
     - `Nearline` for infrequently accessed data (once a month).
     - `Coldline` for rarely accessed data (once a year).
     - `Archive` for long-term storage.

4. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - Define lifecycle rules to automatically transition objects between storage classes or delete them based on age or conditions.
   - Example: Move objects older than 90 days to `Coldline` storage.

## Object Management Standards

1. **Object Naming**:
   - Use a structured naming convention. Example: `YYYY/MM/DD/logs/file-name`.
   - Avoid special characters and spaces in object names.

2. **Versioning**:
   - Enable object versioning on buckets to retain previous versions of objects.
   - Set lifecycle rules to delete older versions after a specific period.

3. **Compression**:
   - Compress large files (e.g., GZIP) to save storage space and reduce bandwidth usage.

4. **Data Organization**:
   - Organize data using folder-like structures for easy navigation.
   - Avoid deep hierarchies to improve performance.

---

## Access and Permissions

1. **IAM Roles**:
   - Use predefined roles such as `roles/storage.objectViewer`, `roles/storage.objectAdmin`, or `roles/storage.bucketAdmin`.
   - Follow the principle of least privilege by granting only the required permissions.

2. **Service Accounts**:
   - Use service accounts for application access to buckets and objects.
   - Assign specific roles to service accounts for granular control.

3. **Public Access**:
   - Avoid publicly accessible buckets unless absolutely necessary.
   - Use signed URLs or signed policy documents for temporary access.

4. **Access Logs**:
   - Enable access logs to track who accessed your buckets or objects.

---

## Data Security and Compliance

1. **Encryption**:
   - Use server-side encryption for all objects (enabled by default).
   - For sensitive data, use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK).

2. **Data Loss Prevention**:
   - Enable bucket versioning to recover from accidental deletions.
   - Regularly back up critical data to another bucket or service.

3. **Compliance**:
   - Ensure buckets meet compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
   - Use labels to tag buckets with compliance metadata.

---

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **Monitoring**:
   - Enable Cloud Monitoring to track bucket metrics such as storage usage and request counts.
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity.

2. **Logging**:
   - Enable Cloud Audit Logs for detailed access and modification logs.
   - Use logs to monitor unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Use storage insights to identify unused or duplicate objects.
   - Implement lifecycle rules to delete stale data and optimize storage class usage.
