## General Guidelines
- Always use a modular approach to design your pipelines.
- Write clean and readable code—comment on non-obvious logic.
- Ensure solutions are scalable to handle large datasets.
- Use Dataflow templates where applicable to simplify deployment.

---

## Naming Conventions
- **Pipelines and Jobs:** Use descriptive names (e.g., `user_data_aggregation_pipeline`).
- **Variables and Functions:** Use `snake_case` for variable names and `CamelCase` for class names.
- **Resources:** Prefix resources with the project name or team identifier (e.g., `teamname_projectname_bucket`).

---

## Pipeline Design
- Prefer **ParDo** transforms for custom processing logic.
- Use **Composite Transforms** to encapsulate reusable logic.
- Design pipelines to be **idempotent** and **fault-tolerant**.
- Leverage **windowing** and **triggers** for streaming data.
- Optimize for **shuffle** and **grouping** operations to minimize costs.

---

## Code Organization
- Group related transforms into separate Python/Java modules.
- Maintain a clear separation of batch and streaming pipelines.
- Use configuration files or environment variables for pipeline parameters.

---

## Error Handling
- Implement proper exception handling in all custom DoFns.
- Use **dead-letter queues** for unprocessable records.
- Log errors with enough context for debugging.

---

## Logging and Monitoring
- Use **Cloud Logging** for pipeline logs.
- Implement metrics using **Beam’s Metrics API** for tracking pipeline health.
- Enable **Dataflow Monitoring Interface** for job performance insights.

---

## Testing
- Write **unit tests** with small datasets to test each transform’s logic.
- Use **integration tests** to validate end-to-end pipeline workflows.
- Mock external systems for isolated and repeatable tests.

---

## Version Control
- Use feature branches for development.
- Write descriptive commit messages for changes.
- Tag releases for stable pipeline versions.

---

## Documentation
- Include a README file describing the pipeline’s purpose, inputs, and outputs.
- Document all parameters in a separate section or configuration file.
- Use inline comments for complex logic within the code.

---

## Contribution Guidelines
- Follow this style guide for all new pipelines and updates.
- Submit changes via pull requests with proper reviews.
- Ensure all pipelines pass tests before merging.
